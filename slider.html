                <p class="pp">Africa, the second largest continent, is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, 
                    the Indian Ocean, and the Atlantic Ocean.Africa's physical geography, environment and
                    resources,and human geography can be considered separately.
                    Africa has eight major physical regions: the Sahara, the Sahel, the Ethiopian Highlands, 
                    the savanna, the Swahili Coast, the rainforest, the African Great Lakes, and southern Africa.
                    Some of these regions cover large bands of the continent, such as the Sahara and Sahel,
                    while others are isolated areas, such as the Ethiopian Highlands and the Great Lakes.
                    Each of these regions has unique animal 
                    and plant communities..</p>
